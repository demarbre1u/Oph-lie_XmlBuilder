### What is this repository for? ###

This repository contains a small Ruby program that can build an XML file from an image and a textfield.

It was originaly created to generate the XML files that would've been required for the "Oph√©lie" project.

Both project have been abandonned, but the program is working, though it doesn't have all the functionnalities it should've had.

### How do I get set up? ###

You might need to install some GTK2 related packages for this program to work.

Aside from these and Ruby itself, nothing else should be required.
